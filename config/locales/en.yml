A game template is an entertainment game that has included the SGAME API in order to show learning objects to the players when certain events are triggered. Game templates define the specific events whose triggering will cause a learning object to be shown as well as the rewards that players will receive when they successfully complete one of these learning objects. After chossing a game template, you should click on the 'Select game template' button to advance to the next step."

After selecting a SCORM package, you will be able to select any learning object contained in that package. You can select all the learning objects of a package by clicking on the 'Add all learning objects' button as well as select only some learning objects by clicking on the 'plus' icon placed at the right side of each row of the learning object table. Learning objects from different SCORM packages can be added.
