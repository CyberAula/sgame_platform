This library has been developed based on https://github.com/mindset/scorm.

SCORM is a Ruby library for reading and extracting Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) files. SCORM is a standardized package format used mainly by e-learning software to help with the exchange of course material between systems in an interoperable way. This gem supports SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004. The gem can both be used as a library in your application or as a command line tool. This gem does NOT handle the run-time part of the SCORM standard, only the so called "Content Aggregation Model".
